# Project Name

> A new repository was created for the Odin Porject project "Project: Rock Paper Scissors". Rock Paper Scissors (also known as Rochambeau, Roshambo or Janken) is an easy and fun sleight-of-hand game that anyone can learn and enjoy. It's a great way to make minor decisions when you and a friend can't agree on something, or even just an entertaining way to pass the time. The great thing about the game is that almost anyone can learn the rules in a matter of seconds.
